# Simple Python Version Management: pyenv

pyenv lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. It's
simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose
tools that do one thing well.

This project was forked from [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and.
[ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build) and modified for Python.

### pyenv _doesâ€¦_

* Let you **change the global Python version** on a per-user basis.
* Provide support for **per-project Python versions**.
* Allow you to **override the Python version** with an environment
  variable.

## <a name="section_1"></a> 1 How It Works

pyenv operates on the per-user directory `~/.pyenv`. Version names in
pyenv correspond to subdirectories of `~/.pyenv/versions`. For
example, you might have `~/.pyenv/versions/2.7.3` and
`~/.pyenv/versions/2.7.3`.

Each version is a working tree with its own binaries, like
`~/.pyenv/versions/2.7.3/bin/python2.7` and
`~/.pyenv/versions/3.2.3/bin/python3.2`. pyenv makes _shim binaries_
for every such binary across all installed versions of Python.

These shims are simple wrapper scripts that live in `~/.pyenv/shims`
and detect which Python version you want to use. They insert the
directory for the selected version at the beginning of your `$PATH`
and then execute the corresponding binary.

Because of the simplicity of the shim approach, all you need to use
pyenv is `~/.pyenv/shims` in your `$PATH`.

### <a name="section_2.1"></a> 2.1 Basic GitHub Checkout

This will get you going with the latest version of pyenv and make it
easy to fork and contribute any changes back upstream.

1. Check out pyenv into `~/.pyenv`.

        $ cd
        $ git clone git://github.com/yyuu/pyenv.git .pyenv

2. Add `~/.pyenv/bin` to your `$PATH` for access to the `pyenv`
   command-line utility.

        $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

    **Zsh note**: Modify your `~/.zshenv` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

3. Add pyenv init to your shell to enable shims and autocompletion.

        $ echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile

    **Zsh note**: Modify your `~/.zshenv` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

4. Restart your shell so the path changes take effect. You can now
   begin using pyenv.

        $ exec $SHELL

5. Install Python versions into `~/.pyenv/versions`. For example, to
   install Python 2.7.3, download and unpack the source, then run:

        $ pyenv install 2.7.3

6. Rebuild the shim binaries. You should do this any time you install
   a new Python binary (for example, when installing a new Python version,
   or when installing a gem that provides a binary).

        $ pyenv rehash

#### <a name="section_2.1.1"></a> 2.1.1 Upgrading

If you've installed pyenv using the instructions above, you can
upgrade your installation at any time using git.

To upgrade to the latest development version of pyenv, use `git pull`:

    $ cd ~/.pyenv
    $ git pull

To upgrade to a specific release of pyenv, check out the corresponding
tag:

    $ cd ~/.pyenv
    $ git fetch
    $ git tag
    v0.1.0
    v0.1.1
    v0.1.2
    v0.2.0
    $ git checkout v0.2.0

## <a name="section_4"></a> 4 Development

The pyenv source code is [hosted on
GitHub](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv). It's clean, modular,
and easy to understand, even if you're not a shell hacker.

tracker](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv/issues).
