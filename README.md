# Simple Python Version Management: pyenv

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yyuu/pyenv.png)](https://travis-ci.org/yyuu/pyenv)

pyenv lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. It's
simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose
tools that do one thing well.

This project was forked from [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and
[ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build), and modified for Python.

### pyenv _does..._

* Let you **change the global Python version** on a per-user basis.
* Provide support for **per-project Python versions**.
* Allow you to **override the Python version** with an environment
  variable.
* Search commands from **multiple versions of Python at a time**.
  This may be helpful to test across Python versions with [tox](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox).


### In contrast with pythonbrew and pythonz, pyenv _does not..._

* **Depend on Python itself.** pyenv was made from pure shell scripts.
    There is no bootstrap problem of Python.
* **Need to be loaded into your shell.** Instead, pyenv's shim
    approach works by adding a directory to your `$PATH`.
* **Manage virtualenv.** Of course, you can create [virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv)
    yourself, or [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenv)
    to automate the process.

## How It Works

At a high level, pyenv intercepts Python commands using shim
executables injected into your `PATH`, determines which Python version
has been specified by your application, and passes your commands along
to the correct Python installation.


### Understanding PATH

When you run a command like `python` or `pip`, your operating system
searches through a list of directories to find an executable file with
that name. This list of directories lives in an environment variable
called `PATH`, with each directory in the list separated by a colon:

    /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

Directories in `PATH` are searched from left to right, so a matching
executable in a directory at the beginning of the list takes
precedence over another one at the end. In this example, the
`/usr/local/bin` directory will be searched first, then `/usr/bin`,
then `/bin`.


### Understanding Shims

pyenv works by inserting a directory of _shims_ at the front of your
`PATH`:

    ~/.pyenv/shims:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

Through a process called _rehashing_, pyenv maintains shims in that
directory to match every Python command across every installed version
of Pythonâ€”`python`, `pip`, and so on.

Shims are lightweight executables that simply pass your command along
to pyenv. So with pyenv installed, when you run, say, `pip`, your
operating system will do the following:

* Search your `PATH` for an executable file named `pip`
* Find the pyenv shim named `pip` at the beginning of your `PATH`
* Run the shim named `pip`, which in turn passes the command along to
  pyenv


### Choosing the Python Version

When you execute a shim, pyenv determines which Python version to use by
reading it from the following sources, in this order:

1. The `PYENV_VERSION` environment variable (if specified). You can use
   the [`pyenv shell`](#pyenv-shell) command to set this environment
   variable in your current shell session.

2. The application-specific `.python-version` file in the current
   directory (if present). You can modify the current directory's
   `.python-version` file with the [`pyenv local`](#pyenv-local)
   command.

3. The first `.python-version` file found (if any) by searching each parent
   directory, until reaching the root of your filesystem.

4. The global `~/.pyenv/version` file. You can modify this file using
   the [`pyenv global`](#pyenv-global) command. If the global version
   file is not present, pyenv assumes you want to use the "system"
   Python. (In other words, whatever version would run if pyenv weren't in your
   `PATH`.)


### Locating the Python Installation

Once pyenv has determined which version of Python your application has
specified, it passes the command along to the corresponding Python
installation.

Each Python version is installed into its own directory under
`~/.pyenv/versions`. 

For example, you might have these versions installed:

* `~/.pyenv/versions/2.7.6/`
* `~/.pyenv/versions/3.3.3/`
* `~/.pyenv/versions/pypy-2.2.1/`

As far as pyenv is concerned, version names are simply the directories in
`~/.pyenv/versions`.


## Installation

If you're on Mac OS X, consider
[installing with Homebrew](#homebrew-on-mac-os-x).


### The automatic installer

Visit my other project:
https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-installer


### Basic GitHub Checkout

This will get you going with the latest version of pyenv and make it
easy to fork and contribute any changes back upstream.

1. **Check out pyenv where you want it installed.** A good place to choose is
`$HOME/.pyenv` but you may install it somewhere else.

        $ cd
        $ git clone git://github.com/yyuu/pyenv.git .pyenv


2. **Define environment variable `PYENV_ROOT`** to point to the path where
pyenv repo is cloned and add `$PYENV_ROOT/bin` to your `$PATH` for access 
to the `pyenv` command-line utility.

        $ echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bash_profile
        $ echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

    **Zsh note**: Modify your `~/.zshenv` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.
    **Ubuntu note**: Modify your `~/.bashrc` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

3. **Add `pyenv init` to your shell** to enable shims and autocompletion.

        $ echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile

    **Zsh note**: Modify your `~/.zshenv` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.
    **Ubuntu note**: Modify your `~/.bashrc` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

4. **Restart your shell so the path changes take effect.** You can now
   begin using pyenv.

        $ exec $SHELL

5. **Install Python versions into `$PYENV_ROOT/versions`.** For example, to
   install Python 2.7.6, download and unpack the source, then run:

        $ pyenv install 2.7.6

   **NOTE** If you need to pass configure option to build, please use
   ```CONFIGURE_OPTS``` environment variable.
   
   **NOTE** If you are having trouble installing a python version please visit the wiki page about [Common Build Problems](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv/wiki/Common-build-problems)

6. **Rebuild the shim binaries.** You should do this any time you install
   a new Python binary. (Examples: installing a new Python version,
   or installing a package that provides a binary.)

        $ pyenv rehash


#### Upgrading

If you've installed pyenv using the instructions above, you can
upgrade your installation at any time using git.

To upgrade to the latest development version of pyenv, use `git pull`:

    $ cd ~/.pyenv
    $ git pull

To upgrade to a specific release of pyenv, check out the corresponding
tag:

    $ cd ~/.pyenv
    $ git fetch
    $ git tag
    v0.1.0
    $ git checkout v0.1.0


### Homebrew on Mac OS X

You can also install pyenv using the
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) package manager on Mac OS X.

~~~
$ brew update
$ brew install pyenv
~~~

To upgrade pyenv in the future, just use `upgrade` instead of `install`.

After installation, you'll still need to add `eval "$(pyenv init -)"` to your
profile (as stated in the caveats). You'll only ever have to do this
once.


### Neckbeard Configuration

Skip this section unless you must know what every line in your shell
profile is doing.

`pyenv init` is the only command that crosses the line of loading
extra commands into your shell. Coming from rvm, some of you might be
opposed to this idea. Here's what `pyenv init` actually does:

1. **Sets up your shims path.** This is the only requirement for pyenv to
   function properly. You can do this by hand by prepending
   `~/.pyenv/shims` to your `$PATH`.

2. **Installs autocompletion.** This is entirely optional but pretty
   useful. Sourcing `~/.pyenv/completions/pyenv.bash` will set that
   up. There is also a `~/.pyenv/completions/pyenv.zsh` for Zsh
   users.

3. **Rehashes shims.** From time to time you'll need to rebuild your
   shim files. Doing this on init makes sure everything is up to
   date. You can always run `pyenv rehash` manually.

4. **Installs the sh dispatcher.** This bit is also optional, but allows
   pyenv and plugins to change variables in your current shell, making
   commands like `pyenv shell` possible. The sh dispatcher doesn't do
   anything crazy like override `cd` or hack your shell prompt, but if
   for some reason you need `pyenv` to be a real script rather than a
   shell function, you can safely skip it.

To see exactly what happens under the hood for yourself, run `pyenv init -`.


### Uninstalling Python Versions

As time goes on, you will accumulate Python versions in your
`~/.pyenv/versions` directory.

To remove old Python versions, `pyenv uninstall` command to automate
the removal process.

Alternatively, simply `rm -rf` the directory of the version you want 
to remove. You can find the directory of a particular Python version 
with the `pyenv prefix` command, e.g. `pyenv prefix 2.6.8`.


## Command Reference

Like `git`, the `pyenv` command delegates to subcommands based on its
first argument. The most common subcommands are:


### pyenv local

Sets a local application-specific Python version by writing the version
name to a `.python-version` file in the current directory. This version
overrides the global version, and can be overridden itself by setting
the `PYENV_VERSION` environment variable or with the `pyenv shell`
command.

    $ pyenv local 2.7.6

When run without a version number, `pyenv local` reports the currently
configured local version. You can also unset the local version:

    $ pyenv local --unset

Previous versions of pyenv stored local version specifications in a
file named `.pyenv-version`. For backwards compatibility, pyenv will
read a local version specified in an `.pyenv-version` file, but a
`.python-version` file in the same directory will take precedence.


#### pyenv local (advanced)

You can specify multiple versions as local Python at once.

Let's say if you have two versions of 2.7.6 and 3.3.3. If you prefer 2.7.6 over 3.3.3,

    $ pyenv local 2.7.6 3.3.3
    $ pyenv versions
      system
    * 2.7.6 (set by /Users/yyuu/path/to/project/.python-version)
    * 3.3.3 (set by /Users/yyuu/path/to/project/.python-version)
    $ python --version
    Python 2.7.6
    $ python2.7 --version
    Python 2.7.6
    $ python3.3 --version
    Python 3.3.3

or, if you prefer 3.3.3 over 2.7.6,

    $ pyenv local 3.3.3 2.7.6
    $ pyenv versions
      system
    * 2.7.6 (set by /Users/yyuu/path/to/project/.python-version)
    * 3.3.3 (set by /Users/yyuu/path/to/project/.python-version)
      venv27
    $ python --version
    Python 3.3.3
    $ python2.7 --version
    Python 2.7.6
    $ python3.3 --version
    Python 3.3.3


### pyenv global

Sets the global version of Python to be used in all shells by writing
the version name to the `~/.pyenv/version` file. This version can be
overridden by an application-specific `.python-version` file, or by
setting the `PYENV_VERSION` environment variable.

    $ pyenv global 2.7.6

The special version name `system` tells pyenv to use the system Python
(detected by searching your `$PATH`).

When run without a version number, `pyenv global` reports the
currently configured global version.


#### pyenv global (advanced)

You can specify multiple versions as global Python at once.

Let's say if you have two versions of 2.7.6 and 3.3.3. If you prefer 2.7.6 over 3.3.3,

    $ pyenv global 2.7.6 3.3.3
    $ pyenv versions
      system
    * 2.7.6 (set by /Users/yyuu/.pyenv/version)
    * 3.3.3 (set by /Users/yyuu/.pyenv/version)
    $ python --version
    Python 2.7.6
    $ python2.7 --version
    Python 2.7.6
    $ python3.3 --version
    Python 3.3.3

or, if you prefer 3.3.3 over 2.7.6,

    $ pyenv global 3.3.3 2.7.6
    $ pyenv versions
      system
    * 2.7.6 (set by /Users/yyuu/.pyenv/version)
    * 3.3.3 (set by /Users/yyuu/.pyenv/version)
      venv27
    $ python --version
    Python 3.3.3
    $ python2.7 --version
    Python 2.7.6
    $ python3.3 --version
    Python 3.3.3


### pyenv shell

Sets a shell-specific Python version by setting the `PYENV_VERSION`
environment variable in your shell. This version overrides
application-specific versions and the global version.

    $ pyenv shell pypy-2.2.1

When run without a version number, `pyenv shell` reports the current
value of `PYENV_VERSION`. You can also unset the shell version:

    $ pyenv shell --unset

Note that you'll need pyenv's shell integration enabled (step 3 of
the installation instructions) in order to use this command. If you
prefer not to use shell integration, you may simply set the
`PYENV_VERSION` variable yourself:

    $ export PYENV_VERSION=pypy-2.2.1


#### pyenv shell (advanced)

You can specify multiple versions via `PYENV_VERSION` at once.

Let's say if you have two versions of 2.7.6 and 3.3.3. If you prefer 2.7.6 over 3.3.3,

    $ pyenv shell 2.7.6 3.3.3
    $ pyenv versions
      system
    * 2.7.6 (set by PYENV_VERSION environment variable)
    * 3.3.3 (set by PYENV_VERSION environment variable)
    $ python --version
    Python 2.7.6
    $ python2.7 --version
    Python 2.7.6
    $ python3.3 --version
    Python 3.3.3

or, if you prefer 3.3.3 over 2.7.6,

    $ pyenv shell 3.3.3 2.7.6
    $ pyenv versions
      system
    * 2.7.6 (set by PYENV_VERSION environment variable)
    * 3.3.3 (set by PYENV_VERSION environment variable)
      venv27
    $ python --version
    Python 3.3.3
    $ python2.7 --version
    Python 2.7.6
    $ python3.3 --version
    Python 3.3.3


### pyenv versions

Lists all Python versions known to pyenv, and shows an asterisk next to
the currently active version.

    $ pyenv versions
      2.5.6
      2.6.8
    * 2.7.6 (set by /home/yyuu/.pyenv/version)
      3.3.3
      jython-2.5.3
      pypy-2.2.1


### pyenv version

Displays the currently active Python version, along with information on
how it was set.

    $ pyenv version
    2.7.6 (set by /home/yyuu/.pyenv/version)


### pyenv rehash

Installs shims for all Python binaries known to pyenv (i.e.,
`~/.pyenv/versions/*/bin/*`). Run this command after you install a new
version of Python, or install a package that provides binaries.

    $ pyenv rehash


### pyenv which

Displays the full path to the executable that pyenv will invoke when
you run the given command.

    $ pyenv which python3.3
    /home/yyuu/.pyenv/versions/3.3.3/bin/python3.3


### pyenv whence

Lists all Python versions with the given command installed.

    $ pyenv whence 2to3
    2.6.8
    2.7.6
    3.3.3


### pyenv install

Part of [Python-build](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv/tree/master/plugins/python-build), this installs versions of python

    $ pyenv install 2.7.6
    $ pyenv install 2.6.8
    $ pyenv versions
      system
      2.6.8
    * 2.7.6 (set by /home/yyuu/.pyenv/version)


### pyenv install --list

List available remote versions of Python, including Anaconda, Jython, pypy, and stackless

    $ pyenv install --list


## Development

The pyenv source code is [hosted on
GitHub](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv). It's clean, modular,
and easy to understand, even if you're not a shell hacker.
